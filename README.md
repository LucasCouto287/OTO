# ## Inspiration
For the past years, there is an immense shift for e-commerce from traditional marketing to digital marketing. Due to this, several small-scale businesses are losing out and are in danger to fold up adversely affecting their livelihood. With technological advancement, disruption is inevitable. However, in order to foster a more collaborative ecosystem, we are aiming on having these different stakeholders to embrace disruption by fostering an understanding that disruption is not trying to eliminate them but instead will just impact how they do things, thereby still promoting inclusive growth.

Our aim is to look out for other opportunities to tap these traditional touch points to promote Online to Offline (O2O) activities through a decentralized approach. This enable faster growth and wider market spread as the extent can reach unconventional market not previously tapped by digital marketing. 


## What it does
OTO DApp empowers traditional channels such as local stores, mom's and pop's stores and even individuals to be the new channels for Online-To-Offline Marketing and Sales activities through decentralization. 

Companies can tap on these offline touch points by giving them access to product catalogs making them an agent to promote the products and provide new channel for the companies to be able to sell their products resulting in additional revenue. This promotes 

Offline touch points can subscribe and become brand ambassadors to market and sell items on behalf of the company. They will earn incentives for every products purchased within their catalog.

Main considerations for tapping these offline touch points:
1) Location - this extends the geographical coverage that may not be reached by digital marketing. Also, for some cases, location with a specific demographics of consumers can also affect the sales for specific products.
2) Influence - these small business owners usually have recurring and familiar customers where these touch points already have an influence on the consumer behavior.

## How we built it
In order to be able to become a channel to sell the products in the catalog, we implemented a subscription-based model where products are categorized into catalogs and these offline touch points which will be considered now as brand ambassadors will have access depending on the catalog that they subscribed to. We used NuCypher's Proxy Re-encryption mechanism to manage the keys for the subscription model. This ensures that only valid subscribers can access the catalog and will be incentivized .
